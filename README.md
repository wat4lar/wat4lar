- 👋 Hi, my name's Sergii.
- 👀 I’m interested in Front-end development.
- 🌱 I’m currently attending EPAM Front-End Online Program Spring 2022. 
- 💞️ Once I'm done with my learning program, I hope to get an offer or get my hands dirty in cooperating with other developers to build up something amazing. Really looking forward to it! 

- 📫 If you are willing to cooperate or looking a passionate (almost junior) developer to be a part of your team, feel free to contact me. How to reach me:
