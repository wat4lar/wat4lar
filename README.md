- 👋 Hi, my name's Sergii. I live, work and study in Ukraine. 
- 👀 I'm a former tooling design engineer who's switching to front-web development.
- 🌱 Achievements of the previous year 2022: went through  Hillel Front-end Dev Course and also finished SoftServe React Marathon. Currently learning Vuejs which is main target of the beginning of this year. 
- 💞️ I'm keen on learning and am dying to get my hands dirty by building some amazing projects.
